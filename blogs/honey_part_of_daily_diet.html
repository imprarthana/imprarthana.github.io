            Adding natural honey to your regular diet may improve various
            aspects of your health. Honey is a natural sweetener of high
            nutritional value and immense health benefits. The use of honey as a
            food and potential therapeutic agent has been known to mankind since
            time immemorial. It is rich in carbohydrates, mainly fructose and
            glucose. Besides, other vitamins and minerals are found in traces.
            Owing to the presence of high carbohydrate content, honey is an
            excellent alternative to refined sugar. In addition to that, it is
            also an exceptional source of energy.

          <h2>How not to have honey?</h2>
          <p>
            Honey is still a type of sugar, therefore it should be consumed in
            moderation only and should not exceed the limits. There are a few
            things that have to be kept in mind while having honey. Heating and
            cooking honey is not advisable as it may negatively affect its
            properties and alter its chemical composition thereby making it
            toxic. When overheated, the nutrients and enzymes of honey are
            destroyed, its color darkens and it develops a bitter taste. Apart
            from this, honey consumption is not recommended for infants below 12
            months. There are chances that honey may contain a bacteria called
            Clostridium botulinum which causes a rare but severe type of food
            poisoning called botulism in infants. It may even result in
            paralysis.
          </p>

          <h2>Best ways to consume honey</h2>
          <p>
            Experts suggest that the consumption of raw honey is most beneficial
            for the body. Honey can be mixed with milk or water, but make sure
            that the liquid is cooled down before you mix honey in it. It can be
            enjoyed in the form of tea and other beverages to cure ailments such
            as colds and coughs. It can also be used as dressings and toppings
            in some dishes, salads, and shakes.
