          <h2>What does it mean to eat locally?</h2>
          <p>
            You must have been advised to eat local food by your dietician. The
            benefits of eating local food are plenty. Local food has gained
            popularity in recent years and with good reason but do you know what
            exactly is local food? Local food consists of produce and other
            foods grown on the farm of your local community. The “localness” of
            food has been defined in many different ways. For the sake of
            simplicity, the geographical definition of food products coming from
            a 160–400 km radius of being sold or the consumer’s home is often
            used to define local food.
          </p>

          <h2>Why eat local food?</h2>
          <p>
            Concerns about health and the environment have put locally grown
            products in the spotlight across the globe. There are many benefits
            to buying locally grown food, and each person makes their choice for
            different reasons. Locally grown food paves way for important
            economic opportunities, provides health benefits, and helps to
            reduce negative impacts on the environment. It also helps bring the
            community together and gives people the opportunity to make a
            difference.

          <h2>Health benefits of locally grown food</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Nutritional content:</b> Local food comes to your home just after the
            harvest or within some hours of harvest hence it is less likely that
            the nutrient value of fruits and veggies decreases. As soon as a
            food is harvested its nutrient content begins to deteriorate,
            specifically vitamins C, E, A, and some B. Some foods, especially
            fruits and veggies, lose nutrients during transportation and
            storage, making local options usually more nutritious. Therefore,
            local food improves your heart, blood, brain
            gastrointestinal/digestion, and vision health.</p><br> <p><b>Fresh food:</b> When
            grown locally, the crops are picked at their peak of ripeness. On
            the other hand, non-local produce is harvested early in order to be
            shipped and distributed to your local retail store. Food that’s
            sourced from local farms doesn’t need to be shipped from afar and is
            very fresh, especially when it comes to production. At the same
            time, fresh food also fills your mouth with taste.</p><br><p><b>Safer
            Consumption:</b> The chances are less of local food getting contaminated
            since there are fewer steps involved between food being harvested
            and coming to your table. It ensures that you are consuming food
            that has passed the highest safety standards. Local food does not
            travel far so there is no need to use any preservatives to keep it
            fresh. Apart from this, you can always connect with the local
            producers to know how the crop was grown.</p><br><p><b>Seasonal food:</b> Local food
            caters to your body’s seasonal needs. The cycle of seasonal produce
            is perfectly designed to support your health. For instance, the
            people who live in a seaside place, their diet consists of coconuts,
            which is beneficial to their health and helps them adjust to weather
            changes that occur there. Similarly, residents in Rajasthan like
            eating bajra roti because it minimizes thirst.</p>

          <h2>Environmental benefits of locally grown food</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Less pollution:</b> Local food doesn’t have to travel as far to arrive
            on your plate, so it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
            contributes to improving our carbon footprint.</p><br><p><b>Less waste and
            plastic packaging:</b> Local foods yield less pollution and waste due to
            their minimal or complete lack of packaging, processing, and
            transportation. Also, you can always bring your cloth bag to carry
            the veggies back home.</p><br><p><b>Healthier ecosystem:</b> Supporting local farmers
            helps maintain green spaces and farmland in your area. Local farms
            that use sustainable practices may boost biodiversity, protect
            pollinators that are vital to healthy ecosystems, and promote clean
            air, water, and soil. Additionally, farmland attracts other types of
            biodiversity and gives animals, insects, and birds a place to live
            and thrive.</p><br><p><b>Sustainable Agriculture:</b> Eating locally encourages
            sustainable agriculture since it involves the diversification of
            crop variety. Single crops grown over wide area results in the
            deterioration of soil and as a result the nutrient content of food
            also decreases.
          </p>

          <h2>Economic benefits of locally grown food</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Supports local economy: </b>Supporting local farmers and other
            producers, generates employment and benefits the local economy.
            Money spent on buying local foods continues to remain in your local
            economy only, creating local jobs and strong community relations.
            Also, since the food itself moves through fewer hands and travels
            less distance, more of the money you spend will end up in raising
            and growing those foods instead of their packaging and
            transportation.
          </p>

          <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>
            The greatest advantage of eating local food is that it keeps you
            connected to your roots. Consuming local food helps remove the
            detachment from farming that has been created in the modern world.
            It makes you aware of the best farm practices and how your food is
            grown. If you choose to purchase locally you are ensuring that there
            will be more local farms in your community tomorrow. So next time
            when you go shopping for groceries, buy local.
